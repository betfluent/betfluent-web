            <strong>6.2</strong>
            Any funds deposited into your Player Account can only be used for the

            <strong>6.4</strong>
            Some credit card companies classify transactions with BetFluent as 'cash'
            and may place a fixed and/or interest charge from the date of payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6.5</strong>
            To make a withdrawal from your Player Account you will need to fill out the

            It may take 3 to 5 working days to process withdrawal requests. You may
            withdraw funds from your Player Account at any time provided all payments
            have been confirmed and provided you have satisfied our identification
            procedures. This is intended as an additional security measure to prevent
            any unauthorized third parties from withdrawing funds from your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6.7</strong>
            If any sum is incorrectly credited to your Player Account you are obliged
            to notify us, and we are entitled to reverse such credits and/or recover
            such sums from you, even if withdrawn by you or improperly used to
            participate in services on the Website. We reserve the right to cancel or
            reverse any winnings to recover such sums. If you use the sums improperly
            credited to participate in services on the Website, we can cancel and
            reverse any winnings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6.8</strong>
            When you withdraw money from your Player Account the money will be credited
            to a bank account in your name. We may ask you to provide documentary
            evidence of your bank account, for instance in the form of a recent bank
            statement, before we are able to transfer the withdrawal monies into your
            account. You understand that we may only process withdrawal requests once
            we are satisfied that we have confirmed your identity. Where required by
            law, we will require you to furnish your tax identification number prior to
            payout of winnings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6.9</strong>
            There may be a delay of several days before the money is actually credited
            to your bank account.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6.10</strong>
            In order to protect against fraud and collusion, and to comply with
            anti-money laundering requirements, customers may be prevented from
            withdrawing funds until a period of 48 hours has elapsed since their last
            deposit. It is therefore advised that you wait 48 hours from the time of
            your last deposit before making a request to withdraw funds.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6.11</strong>

            <strong>7.4</strong>
            Account Freezing: We may need to freeze your account for any period we see
            fit if we reasonably believe that the account may be used for fraudulent
            purposes or for the purposes of money laundering. We also reserve the right
            to freeze or immediately terminate the account if we reasonably believe
            that you (i) are cheating, (ii) are under the legal age in the territory
            where you reside (in all cases are under 18 years of age), (iii) have
            provided incorrect and/ or false information on registration, or (iv) are
            in a jurisdiction that renders the provision of our services illegal.

            Suspension and Termination: Failure to comply with any of the Terms and
            Conditions, the How to Play rules and the Privacy Policy constitutes a

            <strong>9. Withdrawing From A Game Or Cancellation Of A Game</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>9.1</strong>
            Once you have joined a Game, we reserve the right to deny any requests to

        <p>
            <strong>9.2</strong>
            We reserve the right to suspend contest entries between parties at any
            time. An investigation into unusual or suspicious patterns may be warranted

            this investigation. The company is not liable to the relevant parties
            during the investigation into unusual or suspicious patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>9.3</strong>
            We reserve the right to withhold payment and to cancel and void any entries
            at our absolute discretion where: (i) there is a technological failure;
            (ii) we suspect that you have or may have breached any of these Terms and
            Conditions; (iii) where the integrity of the Game has been called into
            question; or (iv) collusion between players has taken place.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>9.4</strong>
            There may be circumstances where entries may be declared void due to
            reasons specific to a particular sport and you are therefore advised to
            check the How to Play rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>9.4.1</strong>

            <strong>10. Self-Exclusion</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>10.1</strong>
            If at any time you feel as though you are spending too much time or money
            playing BetFluent then we would recommend that you read our section on
            Responsible Play.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>10.2</strong>
            For those players who wish to restrict their access to real money play, we
            provide a voluntary self-exclusion policy, which enables you to close your
            account or restrict your ability to game on the Website. You can ask for
            your BetFluent account to be closed at any time by emailing our customer
            support team at <u>support@betfluent.com</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>10.3</strong>
            During a period of self-exclusion we will use reasonable efforts to not
            send you any marketing material and we cannot accept any deposits or
            entries from you. Once you self-exclude you may not apply to open a new
            account. We will not reopen any self-excluded account, but after the expiry
            of the exclusion period you may contact us and ask for your account to be
            reopened by emailing <u>support@betfluent.com</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>10.4</strong>
            If you wish to self-exclude from BetFluent you may do so at any time by
            going to the Responsible Play page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>10.5</strong>
            In requesting self-exclusion you agree to provide full and accurate
            personal details, now and in the future, so as to allow access to/use of
            BetFluent&#8217;s gaming services to be restricted. If you do choose to
            self-exclude we will use all reasonable endeavors to ensure we comply with
            your self-exclusion. However in agreeing to self-exclude you accept that
            you have a parallel undertaking not to seek to circumvent the
            self-exclusion. Accordingly, BetFluent has no responsibility or liability
            for any subsequent consequences or losses howsoever caused that you may
            suffer or incur if you commence or continue to access or make use of the
            Website through additional online accounts in circumstances where you have
            changed any of the registration details or you provide misleading,
            inaccurate or incomplete details or otherwise seek to circumvent the
            self-exclusion agreed.

        <p>
            <strong>11.2</strong>
            BetFluent reserves the right to alter, amend or supplement the BetFluent
            rewards from time to time in its absolute discretion.
        </p>
        <p>

            BetFluent shall not be liable for any loss including (without limitation)
            any indirect or consequential loss suffered by the Player as a result of
            accepting or using a prize except where liability cannot be excluded by
            law.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>11.4</strong>

            <strong>12.1</strong>
            BetFluent does not pre-screen any content posted or disseminated in the

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>12.2</strong>
            Because the messages are self-moderated, you should understand that when
            using the Game, you might come across some content that you find offensive
            or objectionable. If you do come across such content then you are free to
            register a complaint in relation to this. You should note that the views
            expressed in banter fields, on message boards or in a chat room are the
            views of the individual concerned, not those of BetFluent.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>12.3</strong>

            submit it;
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>12.3.5</strong>
            you are entirely responsible for any content you post on BetFluent;
        </p>

            obscene, objectionable, or inappropriate or which restricts or inhibits any

            <strong>18. Data Tracking System</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>18.1</strong>
            The sports data that BetFluent uses is provided by third party data
            providers. Data collection and allocation processes are subject to human
            error and as such, BetFluent cannot guarantee the accuracy of the data used
            to allocate points scoring in all circumstances, nor do we accept liability
            for any loss or damage resulting from any such inaccuracies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>18.2</strong>
            We are normally able to correct mistakes within a short period of time and
            this may then lead to the points you have been awarded being changed during
            the course of a Game. On occasion alterations may be made to the data
            provided to us by our partners. In such circumstances, BetFluent retains
            sole and absolute discretion to make corrections or amendments to the
            scoring or points allocated during a Game at any time before the pot in
            respect of that Game has been paid out. Corrections or amendments will not
            be made to scoring or points allocation for a Game after the pot payout has
            taken place.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>18.3</strong>
            As with any data feed, there will always be a delay between a real-life
            event and that event showing up in our data feed. Players playing BetFluent
            may have more up-to-date information (for example if they are in the
            stadium where the Match or Game is taking place) or have access to some
            media source that we are not aware of.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>19. How Results Are Determined</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            BetFluent results will be based solely on the data provided by our third
            party data providers, which tracks Games, Match events and Player
            performance. BetFluent will seek to ensure that all results of BetFluent
            games are as accurate and correct as possible but the results are dependent
            upon the veracity and accuracy of the information provided by the third
            party data provider, which is subject to human error and may not be 100%
            accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>20. Picking Players</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>20.1</strong>
            It is your responsibility to keep abreast of team changes and adjust your
            choice of players accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>20.2</strong>
            We encourage you to do your own research and check back right up until
            start of the Game/Match and during the Game/Match to ensure that your
            choices are based on the official player names and player numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>21. Disclaimer On Points Calculation</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>21.1</strong>
            The calculation of points for scoring Games is based on the information
            received from our third party data providers. All players signing up to and
            playing BetFluent recognize that the data feed may be inaccurate and
            subject to human error, which may in turn affect the outcome of any Game.
            By signing up to the site all players accept that it is possible for the
            scoring on BetFluent to be inaccurate. Points will be allocated and Games
            decided on the information provided by our third party data provider at the
            end of each Game, and no alterations will be made to the points allocated
            or payouts awarded if the information from the data feed is subsequently
            corrected or altered.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>21.2</strong>
            The data feed used in Games and therefore the scoring for the Games may
            vary significantly from scoring or information about the same Game/Match on
            other media sources or outlets or betting sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>21.3</strong>
            In some circumstances where there has been an error made in the scoring of
            a Game, and that error has come to BetFluent&#8217;s attention, the scoring
            will be corrected during the course of the Game. Further, BetFluent retains
            sole and absolute discretion to make corrections or amendments to the
            scoring or points allocated during a Game at any time before the pot in
            respect of that Game has been paid out.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>21.4</strong>
            For more information regarding the scoring and points allocation system see
            the How to Play rules.

            <strong>23.1</strong>
            In addition to real money contests, BetFluent may, at its discretion, hold
            free entry contests ("Free to Play Games"), either with or without real
            money prizes, or with prizes of value (including promotional prizes) as
            determined by BetFluent in conjunction with its partners. For the avoidance
            of doubt save (i) as expressly provided in this clause 24; (ii) in the How
            to Play rules for the relevant Free to Play Game; or (iii) to the extent
            that the Terms and Conditions are inconsistent with free entry, the whole
            of the Terms and Conditions apply to Free to Play Games, which are Games
            for the purposes of the Terms and Conditions.

            <strong>23.2</strong>
            The How to Play rules for each Free to Play Game may establish the
            jurisdictions in which a user must be located and of which a user must
            resident in order to enter such Free to Play Game. Eligibility for entry
            into these contests will be determined by BetFluent and can vary dependent
            on the game, prize, sport, competition and such other variable as may be
            determined by BetFluent from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>23.3</strong>
            In order for a user to be eligible to enter a Free to Play Game on
            BetFluent, the user must be a registered account holder with BetFluent.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>23.4</strong>
            Without prejudice to the rights of BetFluent to seek information pursuant
            to the terms of clause 3 above, users may by subject to less restrictive
            requirements under Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations while entering
            exclusively Free to Play Games, but all participants in Free to Play Games
            will be required, as a minimum, to confirm that they are of the legal age
            in the territory in which they reside, but in all cases, at least 18 years
            of age to be a registered account holder with BetFluent. Should a user win
            a cash prize or (in certain circumstances a prize with value), while
            playing a Free to Play Game on BetFluent, they may then be subject to
            account verification should they wish to withdraw their winnings or
            exchange a prize for cash (if applicable in any particular case). Failure
            at this time to provide satisfactory verification will result in forfeiture
            of winnings and could result in closure of the user&#8217;s account.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>23.5 </strong>
            The number of teams a user will be allowed enter into Free to Play Games is
            at the sole discretion of BetFluent and may be altered from game to game at
            the sole discretion of BetFluent. Users attempting to bypass these
            restrictions by using multiple accounts will be automatically disqualified
            and may have their accounts temporarily or permanently suspended.
