            transferable. Promotional Funds may be reclaimed if they go unused for a
            period of more than 3 months. Promotional Funds will be invalidated across
            all accounts if a user opens more than one account.

        </p>
        <p>
            HOW DO I MAKE A DEPOSIT?
        </p>
        <p>
            To make a deposit, login and select the &#8216;Deposit&#8217; link below
            the account balance. Choose a deposit method (we accept Credit and Debit
            Cards) and enter the amount you'd like to deposit. The minimum deposit is
            $10. We have a deposit limitation of $2200 for a 12-month rolling basis.
        This limit can be increased by messaging    <a href="mailto:Support@betfluent.com">Support@betfluent.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            ARE MY FUNDS SAFE?
        </p>
        <p>
            BetFluent ensures that all player funds (your funds) are segregated from
            business operational funds. Please be assured that all player funds are
            safe, secure, and accounted for and that you will have access to your money
            on BetFluent at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
            HOW MUCH DO POOLS COST TO ENTER?
        </p>
        <p>
            BetFluent offers a wide variety of real-money pools, with buy-ins ranging
            from $0 (freerolls) to $250. Prizes vary depending on the rules for that
            pool and type of bet the influencer decides on. Click on a pool and you can
            see the details on the payouts for that specific pool.

        </p>
        <p>
            WHEN DO FUNDS GET CREDITED TO MY ACCOUNT FROM A POOL I'VE WON?
        </p>
        <p>
            We consider pools completed after we receive all final statistics
            confirmation from our official statistics provider for the relevant
            real-life sporting matches. Once this occurs, funds will be credited to the
            winning accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
            WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE ARE STAT CORRECTIONS AFTER MY POOL IS COMPLETE?
        </p>
        <p>
            Occasionally, official scorers may issue a stat-correction after games have
            ended and the official scoring validation process has completed. These
            corrections are rare, but can occur days after a game is played. Therefore,
            any changes to official scoring that occur after pools have been finalized
            will not impact those finalized pools. However - If a bug is uncovered or
            our 3rd party data provider encounters a technological failure our
            finalization process (including payment) may be reversed and redone
            correctly. Note: The official scoring validation &amp; finalization process
            is solely to ensure that BetFluent pool results are determined based on the
            official scoring. Delays during this process may occur as a result of data
            collection or other technical difficulties. BetFluent will not attempt to
            make judgements on scoring rulings.
        </p>
        <p>
            WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS A PAYOUT ADJUSTMENT?
        </p>
        <p>
            Occasionally, payouts may need to be adjusted due to a mistake in the pool
            creation. In these instances, we will always use the payout structure
            dictated prior to the pool beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
            HOW DO I WITHDRAW MY MONEY?
        </p>
        <p>
            Head to your "My Account" page and select the &#8220;Withdraw&#8221;
            button. Choose your withdrawal method (e.g. Check) and enter the necessary
            information. Withdrawal requests must be a minimum of $20. Check cashouts
            are usually processed within 3-5 business days. For users with $600 or more
            in net winnings for a calendar year, we require a valid mailing address and
            a social security number. For free accounts that have won money in a
            freeroll, bonus funds are ineligible to withdraw and we reserve the right
            to reclaim those funds.

            IS THIS SPORTS BETTING?
        </p>
        <p>
            NO, you are NOT making a sports bet. Rather you are deciding to ride with
            or ride AGAINST an influencer. Decisions to participate should be based on
            an influencer&#8217;s performance, as betting lines are subject to change.

        <p>
            I CAN SEE AN INFLUENCER&#8217;S STAGED BET, IS THIS FINAL?
        </p>
        <p>
            NO, Proposed betting lines are subject to change and no bets are final
            until the consensus line is published 10 minutes before the start of the
            relevant sports game. Decisions to participate should be based on an
            influencer&#8217;s performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            CAN AN INFLUENCER CHANGE THEIR DECISION BEFORE THE START OF THE GAME?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, Influencer&#8217;s have the right to change their proposed betting
            decision based on injury reports, risk management, or consensus line
            changes. These changes may occur as late as 20 minutes before the start of
            the relevant game. Influencers interested in changing their decision can
            message <a href="mailto:Support@BetFluent.com">Support@BetFluent.com</a>.
            Every effort will be made to change the relevant decision but BetFluent
            does not guarantee a change can be made in every instance.

        <p>
            WHAT HAPPENS IN A SUSPENDED GAME?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If an event is suspended and the completion of that game will not occur on
            that same calendar day, the pools for that event will be canceled and
            refunded.
        </p>
        <p>
            WHEN DO POOLS GET VOIDED?
        </p>
        <p>
            If any pool is posted incorrectly due to technological or other failure,
            pools will be canceled in advance of them starting, if you have any
        questions on this please email    <a href="mailto:support@BetFluent.com">support@BetFluent.com</a>.

            <strong>BONUS FUNDS</strong>
            <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            WHAT ARE BONUS FUNDS?
        </p>
        <p>
            BetFluent awards bonus funds for various promotions including free pools
            and deposit bonuses. Bonus funds have no cash value outside of BetFluent
            and are ineligible to be cashed out, but may be used without restriction to
            enter any pool on the site. Once these funds are used in a BetFluent pool,
            they become real money. You can view your balance available for cash out on
            the withdrawal page of your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            DO BONUS FUNDS EXPIRE?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, BetFluent bonus funds expire if they are not put in play within one
            month of having been awarded and are eligible to be reclaimed at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            What happens if I cash out my deposit after receiving bonus funds?
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not put your deposit into play before withdrawing, BetFluent
            reserves the right to remove bonus funds associated with that deposit. If
            you believe this was done in error, please contact support@BetFluent.com.

            <strong>RESPONSIBLE PLAY</strong>
            <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            CAN I SELF-EXCLUDE MYSELF FROM BETFLUENT, EITHER FOR A SET PERIOD OF TIME
            OR PERMANENTLY?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, self-exclusion is voluntary and can be requested at any time that
            restricts your ability to play on BetFluent's website. To self-exclude
            yourself, please contact a customer service representative. The
            self-exclusion length is variable but is a minimum of thirty (30) calendar
            days, and includes a lifetime-exclusion option. You have the option to
            select the length of the exclusion. A non-permanent exclusion can only be
            changed before the expiration period by submitting a notarized,
            standard-form letter signed by the self-excluded person whereby the
            exclusion is requested to be revoked. Voluntary exclusions, except for
            permanent exclusions, stay in effect for the period requested. Permanent
            exclusions remain in effect indefinitely, and accounts are not
            automatically reopened until the self-excluded person completes the
            reinstatement process, which requires submission of the notarized,
            standard-form letter
        </p>
        <p>
            CAN I REQUEST A TIMEOUT (OR COOL-OFF) BREAK FROM PARTICIPATION IN
            TOURNAMENT PLAY ON BETFLUENT?
        </p>
        <p>
            Timeouts (or cool-off break) are requested stops in tournament play that
            last from a short period of one day to less than 30 consecutive days.
            Players have the option to set time limits for a timeout by contacting a
            customer service representative at support@BetFluent.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            PARENTAL CONTROLS
        </p>
        <p>
            BetFluent does not permit minors (persons under the age of 18 years, or as
            high as 21 in some states) to register a player account. In the event that
            a parent or guardian is concerned and would like to exclude their minors
            from access to any tournament on BetFluent, they can do so by e-mailing:
            support@betfluent.com - for help in establishing parental controls.
